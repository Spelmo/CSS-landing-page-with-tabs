# README

This README will bring you joy and happiness.

Things I don't want to cover, but, still, I'm doing it because I have to:

* Ruby version 2.5.1

* Team members: Marie-Charlotte Le Morvan (aka 'Goddess'), François De Saporta (aka 'Troll'), Charles Belpois (aka 'Troll Whisperer'). Needless to say who decided the nicknames for everybody.

* Link to the heroku app : https://css-workout.herokuapp.com/

BEWARE : this app is not just gorgeous, it's simply the best. Sunglasses recommended.
