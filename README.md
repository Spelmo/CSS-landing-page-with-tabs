# README

This README will bring you joy and happiness.

Things I don't want to cover, but, still, I'm doing it because I have to:

* **Ruby version** 🔥🔥 2.5.1 🔥🔥

***

* **Team members:** Marie-Charlotte Le Morvan (aka 'Goddess 💋'), François De Saporta (aka 'Troll 💩'), Charles Belpois (aka 'Troll Whisperer 😘💩'). Needless to say who decided the nicknames for everybody.

***

* **Link to the heroku app** :🎉🎉👏👏 https://css-workout.herokuapp.com/  🎉🎉👏👏

BEWARE : this app is not just gorgeous, it's simply the best. Sunglasses recommended. 😎

***

* *This app is a student project for The Hacking Project. It is aimed at getting stronger CSS skills. Most 🔗, while looking incredibly amazing, are non functional. What a downer!*
